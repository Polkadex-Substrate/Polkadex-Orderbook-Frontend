              Polkadex uses an epoch and era based system to organize staking
              rewards and other network operations. An epoch is a period of time
              that lasts for 28 days, during which validators and nomination
              pools can initiate staking or earn rewards. At the end of one
              Epoch (or 28 days), newly staked PDEX become eligible to earn
              rewards, and rewards earned by previously eligible stakers are
              distributed to nominated validators and validator nodes.
